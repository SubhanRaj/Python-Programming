# Keywords in Python

In Python, keywords are reserved words that cannot be used as ordinary identifiers. They must be spelled exactly as they are written. For example, True is a keyword, but TRUE, True_, and true are not.

## Some key points about keywords in Python

* There are 33 keywords in Python 3.10. This number can vary slightly over the course of time.
* Keywords are case sensitive.
* Keywords cannot be used as variable names.
* Keywords cannot be used as function names.
* Keywords cannot be used as any other identifier.

## List of keywords in Python

Following is a list of keywords in Python programming. These keywords are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language.

| Keywords      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| False      | This keyword is used to represent a boolean false. If a statement is false, “False” is printed.       |
| None   | This is a special constant used to denote a null value or a void. Its important to remember, 0, any empty container(e.g empty list) do not compute to None. It is an object of its own datatype – NoneType. It is not possible to create multiple None objects and can assign it to variables.       |
| True | This keyword is used to represent a boolean true. If a statement is true, “True” is printed.|
| and | This keyword is a logical operator.|
| as | This keyword is used to create the alias for the module.|
| assert | This keyword is used for debugging purposes.|
| break | This keyword is used to break the flow of the loop.|
| class | This keyword is used to declare user defined classes.|
| continue | This keyword is used to continue the flow of the loop.|
| def | This keyword is used to declare user defined functions.|
| del | This keyword is used to delete the reference to an object.|
| elif | This keyword is used for conditional statements, it is same as else if.|
| else | This keyword is used for conditional statements.|
| except | This keyword is used with exceptions, what code to run if an exception occurs.|
| finally | This keyword is used with exceptions, a block of code that will be executed no matter if there is an exception or not.|
| for | This keyword is used to control flow and for looping.|
| from | This keyword is used to import specific functions from the module.|
| global | This keyword is used to define a variable inside the function to be of a global scope.|
| if | tThis keyword is used to control flow and for conditional statements.|
| import | This keyword is used to import modules into the current namespace.|
| in | This keyword is used to check if a container contains a value.|
| is | This keyword is used to test object identity, i.e to check if both the objects take the same memory location or not.|
| lambda | This keyword is used to make inline returning functions with no statements allowed internally.|
| nonlocal | This keyword works similar to the global, but rather than global, this keyword declares a variable to point to variable of outside enclosing function, in case of nested functions.|
| not | This keyword is a logical operator.|
| or | This keyword is a logical operator.|
| pass | This keyword is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute.|
| raise | This keyword is used to raise an exception.|
| return | This keyword is used to return from the function.|
| try | This keyword is used to enclose the code that might throw an exception.|
| while | This keyword is used to control flow and for looping.|
| with | This keyword is used to wrap the execution of block of code within methods defined by context manager.|
| yield | This keyword is used like return statement but is used to return a generator.|
