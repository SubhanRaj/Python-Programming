# Python

* Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language.
* Python is designed to be highly readable.
* It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.
* Python is a dynamically typed language with inbuilt support for garbage collection, object-orientation, and dynamic name resolution.

## Brief History of Python

* Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL), capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.
* Its implementation began in December 1989.
* Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's Benevolent Dictator For Life, a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.
* In January 2019, active Python core developers elected Brett Cannon, Nick Coghlan, Barry Warsaw, Carol Willing and Van Rossum to a five-member "Steering Council" to lead the project.
* Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode.
* However, the most important change was to the development process itself, with a shift to a more transparent and community-backed process.
* Python 3.0 (also called "Python 3000" or "Py3K") was released on 3 December 2008.
* It was designed to rectify fundamental design flaws in the languageâ€”the changes required could not be implemented while retaining full backwards compatibility with the 2.x series, which necessitated a new major version number.
* Python 2.7's end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.
* In January 2017, Google announced work on a Python 2.7 to Go transcompiler to improve performance under concurrent workloads.
* In June 2018, Apple Inc. announced that Python 2.7 would be deprecated in macOS 10.15 Catalina, which was released in October 2019.
* Python 2.7.18 was released on 20 April 2020 with new features backported from Python 3.8, the last feature release of Python 2.
* Python 2.7.18 is the last Python 2.7 release and therefore the last Python 2 release.
* Python 2.7 was officially retired on 1 January 2020 and is no longer receiving any bug fixes or updates.
* Python 3.9.0 was released on 5 October 2020.
* Python 3.9.0 is the newest major release of the Python programming language, and it contains many new features and optimizations.
* Python 3.9.0 is the last version providing those features.
* Python 3.10.0a1 was released on 5 December 2020, and Python 3.10.0a2 was released on 19 December 2020.

## Basic Syntax

* Python is a case sensitive programming language.
* Python statements do not need to be terminated by semicolon.
* Python uses indentation for blocks, instead of curly braces.
* Python has no mandatory statement termination characters and blocks are specified by indentation.

```python
# Hello World program in Python
print("Hello World!")
```


## Python:Compiled or Interpreted?

* Python is an interpreted language as opposed to a compiled one, though the distinction can be blurry because of the presence of the bytecode compiler.
* This means that source files can be run directly without explicitly creating an executable which is then run.
* Interpreted languages do not need to be compiled to run.
* Interpreted languages execute code at runtime, whereas compiled languages execute code during a compilation step.
* Python source code is automatically compiled into Python byte code by the CPython interpreter.
* Compiled code is usually stored in PYC (or PYO) files, and is regenerated when the source is updated, or when otherwise necessary.
* The bytecode compiler is accessible as the compiler module.
